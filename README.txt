Instructions
------------

1. In test.cpp you will find some tests
   to get you started. Run them first of all,
   verify they're all passing.

2. Have a look at relevant files to get you started:
    port.h|c    - communicate with port through memory
    fsm.h|c     - the (not finished) Button FSM implementation

3. Ready to write some tests? Here are some scenarios:

 - lamp should turn on when the user presses button
 - lamp should turn off when the doors open
 - port1 should not have any other bit than 7
   modified by the button FSM (several tests possibly)

Happy coding :)
