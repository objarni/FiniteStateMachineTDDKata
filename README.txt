Instructions
------------

1. In test/test.cpp you will find some tests
   to get you started. Run them first of all,
   verify they're all passing.

2. Give the tests better names!

3. Below the tests you will find a
   test list partially crossed off.
   Continue implementing the Button FSM.

Happy coding :)
