Instructions
------------

1. In test.cpp you will find some tests
   to get you started. Run them first of all,
   verify they're all passing.

2. Add tests for the following scenarios:

 - lamp should turn on when the user presses button
 - lamp should turn off when the doors open
 - port1 should not have any other bit than 7
   modified by the button FSM (several tests possibly)

Happy coding :)
